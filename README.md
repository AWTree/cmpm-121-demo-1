This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.
"Eat the Candy!" by scso-ucsc: This project inspired me to enhance the main action button by increasing its size, adding color variations, and a shadow effect for greater visual impact. Their use of a prominent, visually engaging button made the gameplay feel more intuitive, and I’ve applied a similar approach in my design.

"Coffee for Gone" by maozblan: Their project demonstrated the effectiveness of a consistent, thematic color scheme that aligns with the game’s concept. I adopted an earthy background color and consistent button styling, adding depth with shadows, to create an immersive mining theme inspired by their approach.
